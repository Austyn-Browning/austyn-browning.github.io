# Linux! Just getting Started?


One thing that people always ask and want to know is what is the Linux distribution that they need to start out with. So they can have a good first time experience with Linux. If you google that question or top ten Linux distribution you will see a lot of different options. For the most part they are all valid and they have some good ones to get started. However, all of these lists are subjective and in the end I feel like you need to just look at one. Find one you like of look on at one of those lists and just go for it. Linux is all about trying things out and see if they break, be warned make sure you are ready to do some googlefoo as you will always have some question that will need answered. 


I would recommend taking a look at the program called [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) this will let you create and boot able flash drive. This is also something that you can use to try out a few different distros. As you will boot into a live environment and will have the function of that OS but with out the commitment of wiping anything off of your hard drive. 

I can say that I have tried a few different distros during my time with Linux. They all for the most part worked how they intended. Below are a list of some that I have used or I am using. 

# [Anarchy](https://anarchy-linux.org/) – An arch distribution that I have used in the past not bad, easy to install.
# [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) – I wouldn’t recommend plain arch if you are just playing around. As there are a lot of things that you need to know about how Linux work to get the full benefit of the install process.
# [Arco Linux](https://arcolinux.com/) – What I am using right now on my laptop. Has a good installer and you can use different desktop environments with this pretty easily. If you want someone who can talk about it with more knowlege please look up  [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube). He has a weath of knowlege in and on linux as a whole and would be a greate resource to anyone. 
# [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) – I have used this when it was in version 20 something and liked it. I tried it again at 36 and I had issues with it and just want back to arch. 
# [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) -  Not a bad distribution if you want something that will be solid and easy to learn. Not a bad idea at all.
# [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) – Same as Ubuntu built with a beginner in mind. Definitely, has more of a windows UI feel then some other distributions.
# [RockyLinux](https://rockylinux.org/) - I am using this for my server OS right now. I theory you can customize and Linux distribution to work as a server. However Rocky is a fork of Red Hat Linux. Red Hat is used in a lot in enterprise situations. Knowing this I wanted to get some hands on work with something every every close to what would be used in the real world. 

There are other distributions out there at may or may not be right for you! In the end pick one and see how it goes. You can always try something different if you see something that catches your eye.
